    "It has the core elements of the functionality that help define the concept of LCSs. It’s the same family as the fully featured ExSTraCS system, so it is easy to transfer to a state-of-the-art LCS from this shallow learning curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "eLCS complements the forthcoming *Textbook on Learning Classifier Systems*. Each demo is paired with one of the chapters in the textbook. Therefore, there are 5 different versions of an educational learning classiﬁer system (eLCS), as relevant functionality (code) is added to eLCS at each stage. This builds up the eLCS algorithm in its entirety from Demo 1 through to 5. Demo 6 showcases how ExSTraCS may be applied to a real-world data mining example, i.e. large scale bioinformatics. "

This way users can start by examining the simplest version of the code and progress onwards.

    "*All* of the necessary code is below, separated into 'cells' for descriptive purposes. It is verbose and can make it difficult to see important method-code compared with infrastructure-code, so it is nice to be able to hide code on occasion. Jupyter needs the hide_code extension available from: https://github.com/kirbs-/hide_code\n",
    "It can be downloaded and extracted into the Pythod directory.\n",
    "\"pip install hide_code\" from the command prompt then installs the extension. Note a reboot of the server is needed! \n",

Also included in the ﬁle are the following rule parameters: ﬁtness, accuracy, numerosity, TimeStamp, Initial TimeStamp, and Speciﬁcity (just the fraction of speciﬁed attributes in a given rule).
