1. If you already have Jupyter notebooks and Python installed, ignore the installation steps. The instructions below are for Anaconda, but you are, of course, free to use other softwares.
2. For Anaconda, go to https://www.continuum.io/downloads and follow the instructions for your OS.
3. Choose the Python 3.5 installer, and click through the installation steps.
4. Once installed, open the Anaconda Navigator App.
5. In Home/My Applications, click on Jupyter Notebooks.
6. The Jupyter Notebook would now have opened up in your browser. Click on upload and upload the exercise files (eLCS_0.ipynb, eLCS_1.ipynb, ... , eLCS_5.ipynb) available at: 
7. After the upload completes, click on each one of these and go through the files. You can chose to either run each file in its entirety (Cell -> Run All) or run only selected cells (Cell -> Run Cells) or a few other options.
8. One of the benefits of running code in blocks is that you can create logical modules and examine intermediate results to understand the code and flow much better. Try it!
