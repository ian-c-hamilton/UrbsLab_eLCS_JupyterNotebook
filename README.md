# eLCS_JupyterNotebook
Educational Learning Classifier System (eLCS) - Jupyter Notebook implementation of a basic, generic Michigan-style LCS algorithm

This repository houses the Jupyter Notebook formatted eLCS files inteded for use with the LCS Hands-on workshop at GECCO 2016, 
as well as for use with the upcoming textbook by Will Browne and Ryan Urbanowicz titled "An Introduction to Learning Classifier Systems".

Please start by checking out the installation instructions file, to learn how to install the necessary software to view these Jupyter
Notebook files.

Note that there are 6 separate Jupyter Notebook files to be viewed in sequence in order to build a practical understanding of the concepts of how a basic LCS algorithm works, and how it can be implemented. 

This implementation of eLCS was adapted by Will Browne from the original object oriented Python implementation (available in the repository named eLCS).
